    bat_n_ball.vhd

        The bat width decreases one pixel each time successfully hitting the ball and then resets to starting width when missing the ball

        Count the number of successful hits after each serve and display the count on the 7-segment displays

    pong.vhd

        Use the slide switches on the board to program the ball speed

        Avoid setting the speed to zero as the ball will then never reach the bat or wall
