Lab 2: Four-Digit Hex Counter

Build a four-digit (16-bit) counter to display its value on 7-segment displays (See Section 9.1 Seven-Segment Display of the Refenece Manual)
1. Create a new RTL project called hex4counter in Vivado Quick Start

    Click 'Add Files' then add leddec.srcs/sources_1/new/leddec.vhd

    Click 'Create File' then create two new source files of file type VHDL called counter and hexcount

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called hexcount

    Default Part > Boards > Vendor: digilentinc.com > Name: Nexys A7-100T > Click Nexys A7-100T > Next

    New Project Summary > Finish

    Click design sources, copy counter.vhd and hexcount.vhd from the GitHub Raw, and save files

    Click constraints, copy hexcount.xdc from the GitHub Raw, and save file

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation
4. Open implemented design

    Tools > Edit Device Properties > Configuration Modes > Check "Master SPI x1"

5. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board

    The four digit counter counts from 0000 to FFFF

6. Generate memory configuration file and close project

    Move the blue MODE jumper on the board from JTAG to QSPI (Quad-SPI)

    Tools > Generate Memory Configuration File > Format: MCS, Memory Part: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4, Filename: hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.mcs, Load bitstream files: hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.bit, check "Overwrite"

    Open Hardware Manager > Add Configuration Memory Device > xc7a100t_0 > Memory Device: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4 > "Do you want to program the configuration memory device now?" > OK > Memory Device: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4, Configuration file: hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.mcs, PRM file: hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.prm, Address Range: Entire Configuration Memory Device > OK > "Flash programming completed successfully." > OK

    Right click xc7a100t_0 under "Hardware" > Boot from Configuration Memory Device > The four digit counter starts

    File > Close Hardware Manager

    File > Close Project

    POWER OFF > POWER ON > Wait for 9 seconds > The four digit counter starts

    POWER OFF > Move the blue MODE jumper on the board from QSPI to JTAG
