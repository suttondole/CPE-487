Lab 1: Seven-Segment Decoder

    Built a single-digit (4-bit) hex counter to display its value on both four-digit common anode seven-segment LED displays (See Section 9.1 Seven-Segment Display of the Reference Manual)

Project 1 - LED Decoder
1. Create a new RTL project called leddec in Vivado Quick Start

    Create a new source file of file type VHDL called leddec

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called leddec

    Default Part > Boards > Boards Vendor: digilentinc.com > Name: Nexys A7-100T > Click Nexys A7-100T

    New Project Summary > Finish

    Click design sources, copy leddec.vhd from the GitHub Raw, and save file

    Click constraints, copy leddec.xdc from the GitHub Raw, and save file

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation and open implemented design
4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Connect the Nexys A7-100T board to the computer and switch the power ON

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download leddec.runs/impl_1/leddec.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board

5. Slider switches on the Nexys A7-100T board

    Slider switches 6 and 7 to determine which dsiplay is illuminated

    Slider switches 0, 1, 2, and 3 to select the value of 4-bit hex digit

Project 2 - Hex Counter

    Build a 4-bit counter to display a hex character

1. Create a new project called hexcounter in Vivado

    Click 'Add Files' then add leddec.srcs/sources_1/new/leddec.vhd

    Click 'Create File' then create two new source files of file type VHDL called counter and hexcount

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called hexcount

    Default Part > Boards > Vendor: digilentinc.com > Name: Nexys A7-100T

    Click 'Finish'

    Click design sources, copy counter.vhd and hexcount.vhd from the GitHub Raw, and save files

    Click constraints, copy hexcount.xdc from the GitHub Raw, and save file

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation and open implemented design
4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download hexconter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board

    The least significant 7-segment decoder counts cycles from 0 to F
